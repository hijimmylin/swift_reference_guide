Swift has another way of building complex data types called classes. They look similar to structs, but have a number of important differences, including:

You don't get an automatic memberwise initializer for your classes; you need to write your own.
You can define a class as being based off another class, adding any new things you want.
When you create an instance of a class it’s called an object. If you copy that object, both copies point at the same data by default – change one, and the copy changes too.
All three of those are massive differences, so I'm going to cover them in more depth before continuing.
